Twine, that thin but sturdy string, has a surprising amount of power. We use it to bind things together, like tying a present or securing a box. But twine can also create connections in a more unexpected way. Imagine two kids playing with a long piece of twine, each holding an end. If one pulls their end, the other feels it instantly! The twine carries the movement, like a message zipped across a tightrope.

This is kind of like how siblings can be connected. They might fight and tease, but there's still a strong bond between them. What affects one sibling can often affect the other. If one is sad, the other might feel down too. Or, if one is excited about a trip, the other will likely catch the same enthusiasm. Just like the ends of a twine, they're linked, even if it's not always obvious.
