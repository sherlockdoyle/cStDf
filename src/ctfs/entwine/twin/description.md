Twins share a life unlike any other. From the moment they enter the world together, they forge a unique bond. This connection can feel like an invisible thread, letting them know what the other is feeling, even from a distance. They might experience sudden happiness or a wave of sadness at the same time, a silent communication that leaves others baffled.

This special link extends to their actions too. It's not uncommon to see twins finishing each other's sentences, a testament to their shared thoughts. They might show up to school in matching outfits, completely unaware they made the same choice. Or, in a burst of laughter, they blurt out the same funny idea, leaving everyone else wondering if they have a secret code no one else can crack.
