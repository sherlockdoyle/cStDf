```
ThIs_Is_NoT_tHe_FlAg
```

you should input it as

```
cStDf{ThIs_Is_NoT_tHe_FlAg}
```

In this second tutorial, your task is to find the flag and input it in the format described above.

Oh, and one more thing. I do not have any analytics or tracking on this website. However, I'd love to know your thought process for each challenge.
