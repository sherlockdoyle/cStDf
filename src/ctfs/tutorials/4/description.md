In some instances, the format of the flag may be correct, but the case is incorrect. In such situations, you should adjust the case accordingly. This is essentially a continuation of the previous tutorial. For instance, if the flag is

```
CSTDF{FLAG}
```

you should modify it to

```
cStDf{FLAG}
```
