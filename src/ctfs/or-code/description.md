Oh man, let me tell you about our boss. He's just like so many other bosses out there - doesn't know the first thing about technology or how websites actually work. But that doesn't stop him from trying to tell us how to do our jobs!

You know how all the fancy modern websites and apps have those nice rounded corners these days? Well, our boss saw that and now he's obsessed. He wants everything on our website to be rounded. And when I say everything, I mean every single thing!

Get this - we've got some QR codes on our site, right? Those square black and white codes you can scan with your phone. Our boss wants even those to be rounded! Not just rounding the corners a tiny bit, but making the whole QR code into a circle.

It's like he doesn't get that QR codes need to be complete to work properly. You can't just chop off parts of it and expect people to still be able to scan it! A partial QR code is useless - it's all or nothing with those things.

I swear, it feels like he thinks making things round is some kind of magic solution that'll make our website amazing. As if users care more about round corners than actually being able to use the site properly!

It's so frustrating trying to explain why this won't work. It's like he hears "QR code" and just thinks "make it pretty" without considering the actual purpose of the thing. Does he even know what QR stands for or how they function? I bet not!

I'm all for making things look good, but not at the expense of basic functionality. What's next, are we gonna have to make our text round too? Circular buttons are one thing, but a circular QR code? Come on!
