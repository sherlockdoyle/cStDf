I wake up to a strange feeling, as if the city has been waiting for me. Lately, I've found myself smiling at the simplest things. Outside my window, there's a curious sceneâ€”a building with windows aglow in many colors. Venturing to new places to eat every evening has become a new routine. Everything appears very two-dimensional, yet with a strange depth to it. You can feel the pulse of the city in the playful mix of shades across her face. Over the empty road, the building stands, reminiscent of her warm touches and soft glances. Underneath the muted windows, there's an unfamiliar glow I can't quite put my finger on. Hearts and hopes mingle in the glow, making my heart skip a beat. I find myself daydreaming at night, thinking of the colors splitting. Three copies bother me though, three bites of the same food; am I rambling in this dream? Her charm and wit, much like the characters in a romcom, make everything feel enchanting. After all, perhaps these windows tell their own tender tales, more than I realize.
