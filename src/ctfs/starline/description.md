Picture this - the biggest find in history, thanks to the most powerful optical telescope we've ever had. We've got images of a galaxy light-years away. It's a mix of stars and clusters.

What kind of cosmic _alignment_ has taken place? Time to use your little gray brai<small>n ce</small>lls and solve this mystery.
