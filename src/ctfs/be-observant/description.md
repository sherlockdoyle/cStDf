Behold! A sonnet of our puzzling quest,  
This GitHub page, with secret folly dressed.  
For this same game, this project of delight,  
Doth harbor on its face an oversight.

No need to delve in files deep or wide,  
For on the landing page doth error hide.  
A word misspelt, a trifling mistake,  
That long escaped the keenest eye to take.

The author, in his whimsy, left it so,  
To challenge those who seek what's hid below.  
The flag thou seek'st, in this our merry game,  
Is naught but yonder word, restored to fame.

Correct the spelling of this wayward phrase,  
And claim thy prize, deserving of our praise.
