At first, it was just a ringing. A high-pitched whine in my ear that wouldn't quit. But then, it changed. It wasn't just a whine anymore, it was... music. Faint, barely there, but music nonetheless. It would play for hours, a melancholic tune that sent shivers down my spine.

The strangest part? It only happened in my bedroom. Nowhere else. I'd leave the room, and the music would fade. Come back in, and there it was again. It would switch ears sometimes, or play in both at once. And then, just as suddenly as it started, it would disappear. Silence. But I knew it would be back.

This *noise*, it is messing with me. It is like a bad dream I can't wake up from. What secrets can be hidden in this haunting *frequency*? The more I try to ignore it, the louder it seems to get. I just want it to stop. Can you <small>in</small>spect<small> the s</small>o<small>n</small>g<small>â€™s </small>ram<small>ifications</small>? Help me find what's *over* this.
