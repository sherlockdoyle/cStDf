Four years. And so many things have  
transformed. Four long years since I've been away from home. I was living in a foreign country, and now I'm back. I couldn't believe how much my hometown has changed in that time.

The tiny grocery store that used to be at the street corner? It's not so tiny anymore. It's turned into a big supermarket. It was strange to see such a big change.

Then, I went to my old house. Everything was just as I remembered it. My room, my study table, everything was the same. I opened a drawer in my study table and found an old photograph.

The photograph was of me and my childhood friend. We were at a carnival, both of us smiling. Seeing the picture brought back a rush of memories. I remembered that she had given me this picture just before I left. But I was in such a hurry that I didn't have time to look at it properly. I ended up forgetting it in my drawer and didn't take it with me.

I turned the picture over. There was something written on the back. It was her handwriting, I would recognize it anywhere. It said,

<p class="text-center">There's a secret in this picture.</p>

It made me wonder, what could the secret be?
