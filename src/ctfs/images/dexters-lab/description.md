There is a special _image in Dexter_'s laboratory. It was given to him by _his pal at his_ birthday. The image is like a _colorful map_ made of different colors that show a secret. Among these secrets, one stands out - a location marked with the symbol of a _pig, etched in pen_. Can you, standing in for Dexter, discover the pig?
