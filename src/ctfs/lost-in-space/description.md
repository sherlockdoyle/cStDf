Sleeping with loud alarms isn't the best. It's even worse when it's echoing through a spaceship, floating aimlessly in the void. The onboard computer can't figure out the location. Outside, everything is a blinding white. But isn't space supposed to be black? Why is this *space white*?

The computer can't make heads or tails of it. It's time to use the good old-fashioned computer - the brain. There's a strange code on the screen. If it can be cracked, maybe a way out can be found. But the computer's acting up, making the code look all jumbled. Could there be a secret message hidden in there? A secret *language*, perhaps?
