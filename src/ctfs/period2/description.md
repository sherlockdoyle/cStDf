Perodi's nights were filled with terror. What started long ago, didn't stop. It came back, every month, like clockwork.

In her dreams, she will see a man. He would always be there, standing with a knife. The sight of him brought her pain. But the dreams didn't always play out the same way. Sometimes, things were flipped around. The man would appear from a corner, pull out his knife from her stomach, and then leave.

But this time Perodi found herself holding the knife. The man was no longer the one standing in the corner. He was on bed, and she was the one standing with the knife. Everything was jumbled up. It was as if time was playing tricks on her, going in circles or maybe even going backwards. Who could say for sure?

When she woke up from this nightmare, she found a strange message on her phone. It was from a number she didn't recognize.

>Take note of the secret dance,  
>Start at dawn, skip with a prance.  
>Count the steps of four squared stance,  
>Harvest letters in this trance.

What could it mean?
