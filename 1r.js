Lately, I’ve found myself smiling at the simplest things. Outside my window, there’s a curious scene—a building with windows aglow in many colors. Venturing to new places to eat every evening has become a new routine. Everything appears very two-dimensional, yet with a strange depth to it.

Underneath the muted windows, there’s an unfamiliar glow I can’t quite put my finger on. Hearts and hopes mingle in the glow, making my heart skip a beat. I find myself daydreaming at night, thinking of the colors splitting. Three copies bother me though, three bites of the same food; am I rambling in this dream?
